1) very simple
Create an array containing temperatures
Assuming those temps are fahrenheit, convert them into
Celsius, and print them out. Make the conversion a function!

1a) for each of the temperatures, categorize that temperature
as either "a bit chilly", "quite pleasant", "far too hot" and
include that in the printout.
