1) very simple
Create an array containing temperatures
Assuming those temps are fahrenheit, convert them into
Celsius, and print them out. Make the conversion a function!

1a) for each of the temperatures, categorize that temperature
as either "a bit chilly", "quite pleasant", "far too hot" and
include that in the printout.

2) Create an *object* with an apply method, demonstrate that
the ObjectName(x) form invokes that apply method

3) Create a function that takes two positional arguments
with names, one has a default value, show that you can invoke
the function with or without the default value, and also
invoke with named argument passing

3a) optional, if you're done with 2 and 3 inside 15 minutes
create a variable length argument list and call that too.
